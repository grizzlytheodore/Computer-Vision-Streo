# Computer-Vision-Streo

One of the big problems that the computer vision field still faces today is streo. 
Streo is having two different focals points looking at the same things from two slightly different angles 
to merge into one focal image.
The most common example is our eyes. The left and the right eyes see slights different pictures but our brain can 
merge them flawlessly. Even the most recent methods are flawed in some parts and not fast enough to have any
commercial use. 

"Homework2.Streo.pdf" documentation shows the steps taken to find the disparity, distance between two focal points.
